I made a python project which is rocking_notes_2021. Itâ€™s a note-taking app. Below I describe some features.
  1.	User can sign up for an account.
  2.	User can sign in to his created account.
  3.	User can create notes in his account.
  4.	User can delete a note if he did not want it.
  5.	User can edit his note if he/she finds some mistake.
  6.	User can fetch/share his note with another user.


I use the rest framework for the main API Server application. And use SQLite for the database.
